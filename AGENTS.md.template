## 🌊 TIDE WATCH: Context Window Monitoring

**Proactive capacity management to prevent session lockups.**

**Monitoring schedule:**
- Check `session_status` approximately **once per hour** during active conversations
- Check during **intensive project work** (reading many files, generating long outputs)
- Check when I notice **unusually long conversations** accumulating

**Warning thresholds:** (customize or use defaults)
- **75%** (150k/200k): 🟡 "Heads up: Context at 75%. Consider wrapping up or switching channels soon."
- **85%** (170k/200k): 🟠 "Context at 85%. Recommend finishing current task and resetting session."
- **90%** (180k/200k): 🔴 "Context at 90%! Session will lock at 100%. Ready to help you reset?"
- **95%** (190k/200k): 🚨 "CRITICAL: Context at 95%! Save important info to memory NOW and reset."

**Auto-backup:** (future feature - coming soon)
- Enabled: false
- Trigger at thresholds: [90, 95]
- Retention: 7 days
- Compress: true

**Actions to suggest:**
1. **Memory save**: Offer to save current context/decisions to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or project work logs
2. **Channel switch**: Suggest moving to lower-usage session (webchat, DM, etc.)
3. **Session reset**: Provide reset command and context-restoration prompt
4. **File reference**: For project work, remind that docs persist in files

**Implementation:**
- Silent check (don't spam with status unless approaching threshold)
- Only warn once per threshold (track internally during session)
- At 90%+, be insistent but helpful
- Never let session hit 100% without warning

**Why this matters:** Proactive monitoring prevents lost work and frustration when sessions lock at capacity.
